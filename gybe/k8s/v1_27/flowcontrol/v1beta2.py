    Attributes:
        assuredConcurrencyShares: `assuredConcurrencyShares` (ACS) configures the execution limit, which is a
            limit on the number of requests of this priority level that may be exeucting at a given time.  ACS
            must be a positive number. The server's concurrency limit (SCL) is divided among the concurrency-
            controlled priority levels in proportion to their assured concurrency shares. This produces the
            assured concurrency value (ACV) --- the number of requests that may be executing at a time --- for

            ACS(k) ) )  bigger numbers of ACS mean more reserved concurrent requests (at the expense of every
            other PL). This field has a default value of 30.
        borrowingLimitPercent: `borrowingLimitPercent`, if present, configures a limit on how many seats this
            priority level can borrow from other priority levels. The limit is known as this level's
            BorrowingConcurrencyLimit (BorrowingCL) and is a limit on the total number of seats that this

            concurrency limit. When this field is non-nil, it must hold a non-negative integer and the limit

            The value of this field can be more than 100, implying that this priority level can borrow a
            number of seats that is greater than its own nominal concurrency limit (NominalCL). When this
            field is left `nil`, the limit is effectively infinite.
        lendablePercent: `lendablePercent` prescribes the fraction of the level's NominalCL that can be
            borrowed by other priority levels. The value of this field must be between 0 and 100, inclusive,
            and it defaults to 0. The number of seats that other levels can borrow from this level, known as
            this level's LendableConcurrencyLimit (LendableCL), is defined as follows.  LendableCL(i) = round(
