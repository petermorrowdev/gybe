    Attributes
    ----------
        backend: backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to.
        path: path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters
            disallowed from the conventional 'path' part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin
            with a '/' and must be present when using PathType with value 'Exact' or 'Prefix'.
        pathType: pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can be one of the
            following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path
            prefix split by '/'. Matching is   done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers
            is the   list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a   match for path p
            if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the   request path. Note that if the last element of
            the path is a substring   of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
            matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz). * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of
            the Path matching is up to   the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate
            PathType   or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types. Implementations are required to
