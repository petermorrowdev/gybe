class Endpoint:
    """Endpoint represents a single logical 'backend' implementing a service.

    Attributes
    ----------
        addresses: addresses of this endpoint. The contents of this field are interpreted according to the
            corresponding EndpointSlice addressType field. Consumers must handle different types of addresses
            in the context of their own capabilities. This must contain at least one address but no more than
            100. These are all assumed to be fungible and clients may choose to only use the first element.
            Refer to: https://issue.k8s.io/106267
        conditions: conditions contains information about the current status of the endpoint.
        deprecatedTopology: deprecatedTopology contains topology information part of the v1beta1 API. This
            field is deprecated, and will be removed when the v1beta1 API is removed (no sooner than
            kubernetes v1.24).  While this field can hold values, it is not writable through the v1 API, and
            any attempts to write to it will be silently ignored. Topology information can be found in the
            zone and nodeName fields instead.
        hints: hints contains information associated with how an endpoint should be consumed.
        hostname: hostname of this endpoint. This field may be used by consumers of endpoints to distinguish
            endpoints from each other (e.g. in DNS names). Multiple endpoints which use the same hostname
            should be considered fungible (e.g. multiple A values in DNS). Must be lowercase and pass DNS
            Label (RFC 1123) validation.
        nodeName: nodeName represents the name of the Node hosting this endpoint. This can be used to
            determine endpoints local to a Node.
        targetRef: targetRef is a reference to a Kubernetes object that represents this endpoint.
        zone: zone is the name of the Zone this endpoint exists in.

            interpret this unknown state as ready. For compatibility reasons, ready should never be 'true' for
            terminating endpoints, except when the normal readiness behavior is being explicitly overridden,
            for example when the associated Service has set the publishNotReadyAddresses flag.
        serving: serving is identical to ready except that it is set regardless of the terminating state of
            endpoints. This condition should be set to true for a ready endpoint that is terminating. If nil,
            consumers should defer to the ready condition.
        terminating: terminating indicates that this endpoint is terminating. A nil value indicates an unknown
            state. Consumers should interpret this unknown state to mean that the endpoint is not terminating.

            defined prefixed names:   * 'kubernetes.io/h2c' - HTTP/2 over cleartext as described in

            no more than 63 characters long. * must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-'. *
            must start and end with an alphanumeric character. Default is empty string.
        port: port represents the port number of the endpoint. If this is not specified, ports are not
            restricted and must be interpreted in the context of the specific consumer.
