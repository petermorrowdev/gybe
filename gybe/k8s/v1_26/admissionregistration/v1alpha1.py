class MatchResources:
    """MatchResources decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether it
    meets the match criteria. The exclude rules take precedence over include rules (if a resource matches
    both, it is excluded)

    Attributes
    ----------
        excludeResourceRules: ExcludeResourceRules describes what operations on what resources/subresources
            the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy should not care about. The exclude rules take precedence over
            include rules (if a resource matches both, it is excluded)
        matchPolicy: matchPolicy defines how the 'MatchResources' list is used to match incoming requests.
            Allowed values are 'Exact' or 'Equivalent'.  - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a
            specified rule. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and
            extensions/v1beta1, but 'rules' only included `apiGroups:['apps'], apiVersions:['v1'], resources:
            ['deployments']`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the
            ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.  - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules,
            even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1,
            apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and 'rules' only included `apiGroups:['apps'],
            apiVersions:['v1'], resources: ['deployments']`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1
            would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.  Defaults to 'Equivalent'
        namespaceSelector: NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object
            based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object itself is a
            namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster
            scoped resource, it never skips the policy.  For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose
            namespace is not associated with 'runlevel' of '0' or '1';  you will set the selector as follows:
            'namespaceSelector': {   'matchExpressions': [     {       'key': 'runlevel',       'operator':
            'NotIn',       'values': [         '0',         '1'       ]     }   ] }  If instead you want to
            only run the policy on any objects whose namespace is associated with the 'environment' of 'prod'
            or 'staging'; you will set the selector as follows: 'namespaceSelector': {   'matchExpressions': [
            {       'key': 'environment',       'operator': 'In',       'values': [         'prod',
            'staging'       ]     }   ] }  See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-
            objects/labels/ for more examples of label selectors.  Default to the empty LabelSelector, which
            matches everything.
        objectSelector: ObjectSelector decides whether to run the validation based on if the object has
            matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject and newObject that would
            be sent to the cel validation, and is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A
            null object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object
            that cannot have labels (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered
            to match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users may skip the
            admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches
            everything.
        resourceRules: ResourceRules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the
            ValidatingAdmissionPolicy matches. The policy cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule.

            '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to
            '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'.

            semantics of the list type:   - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all
            elements in `X` are preserved and     non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining
            their partial order.   - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in
            `X` are preserved but the values     are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and
            `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with     non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their
            partial order. Required.
