        rule: Rule represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref:
            https://github.com/google/cel-spec The Rule is scoped to the location of the x-kubernetes-
            validations extension in the schema. The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the
            scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {'rule':
            'self.status.actual <= self.spec.maxDesired'}  If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties,
            the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence
            can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL
            expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value
            of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self`
            and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If
            the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by
            macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value.
            Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {'rule': 'self.components['Widget'].priority < 10'} -
            Rule scoped to a list of integers: {'rule': 'self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)'} -
            Rule scoped to a string value: {'rule': 'self.startsWith('kube')'}  The `apiVersion`, `kind`,
            `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and

            accessible.  Unknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields
            is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by
            object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property
            schema is of an 'unknown type'. An 'unknown type' is recursively defined as:   - A schema with no
            type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true   - An array where the items schema is
            of an 'unknown type'   - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an 'unknown type'
            Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property
            names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes
            to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to
            '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'.
            The keywords are:           'true', 'false', 'null', 'in', 'as', 'break', 'const', 'continue',
            'else', 'for', 'function', 'if',           'import', 'let', 'loop', 'package', 'namespace',
            'return'. Examples:   - Rule accessing a property named 'namespace': {'rule': 'self.__namespace__
            > 0'}   - Rule accessing a property named 'x-prop': {'rule': 'self.x__dash__prop > 0'}   - Rule
            accessing a property named 'redact__d': {'rule': 'self.redact__underscores__d > 0'}  Equality on
            arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1].
            Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:   - 'set':
            `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and
            non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.   - 'map': `X + Y`
            performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values     are
            overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with
            non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.
