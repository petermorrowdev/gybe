@dataclass
class CSIDriverSpec(K8sSpec):
    """CSIDriverSpec is the specification of a CSIDriver.

    Attributes:
        attachRequired: attachRequired indicates this CSI volume driver requires an attach operation (because
            it implements the CSI ControllerPublishVolume() method), and that the Kubernetes attach detach
            controller should call the attach volume interface which checks the volumeattachment status and
            waits until the volume is attached before proceeding to mounting. The CSI external-attacher
            coordinates with CSI volume driver and updates the volumeattachment status when the attach
            operation is complete. If the CSIDriverRegistry feature gate is enabled and the value is specified
            to false, the attach operation will be skipped. Otherwise the attach operation will be called.
            This field is immutable.
        fsGroupPolicy: fsGroupPolicy defines if the underlying volume supports changing ownership and
            permission of the volume before being mounted. Refer to the specific FSGroupPolicy values for
            additional details.  This field was immutable in Kubernetes < 1.29 and now is mutable.  Defaults
            to ReadWriteOnceWithFSType, which will examine each volume to determine if Kubernetes should
            modify ownership and permissions of the volume. With the default policy the defined fsGroup will
            only be applied if a fstype is defined and the volume's access mode contains ReadWriteOnce.
        podInfoOnMount: podInfoOnMount indicates this CSI volume driver requires additional pod information
            (like podName, podUID, etc.) during mount operations, if set to true. If set to false, pod
            information will not be passed on mount. Default is false.  The CSI driver specifies
            podInfoOnMount as part of driver deployment. If true, Kubelet will pass pod information as
            VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume() calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and
            validating the information passed in as VolumeContext.  The following VolumeContext will be passed
            if podInfoOnMount is set to true. This list might grow, but the prefix will be used.
            'csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name': pod.Name 'csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.namespace': pod.Namespace
            'csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.uid': string(pod.UID) 'csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral': 'true' if the volume
            is an ephemeral inline volume                                 defined by a CSIVolumeSource,
            otherwise 'false'  'csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral' is a new feature in Kubernetes 1.16. It is only
            required for drivers which support both the 'Persistent' and 'Ephemeral' VolumeLifecycleMode.
            Other drivers can leave pod info disabled and/or ignore this field. As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn't
            support this field, drivers can only support one mode when deployed on such a cluster and the
            deployment determines which mode that is, for example via a command line parameter of the driver.
            This field was immutable in Kubernetes < 1.29 and now is mutable.
        requiresRepublish: requiresRepublish indicates the CSI driver wants `NodePublishVolume` being
            periodically called to reflect any possible change in the mounted volume. This field defaults to
            false.  Note: After a successful initial NodePublishVolume call, subsequent calls to
            NodePublishVolume should only update the contents of the volume. New mount points will not be seen
            by a running container.
        seLinuxMount: seLinuxMount specifies if the CSI driver supports '-o context' mount option.  When
            'true', the CSI driver must ensure that all volumes provided by this CSI driver can be mounted
            separately with different `-o context` options. This is typical for storage backends that provide
            volumes as filesystems on block devices or as independent shared volumes. Kubernetes will call
            NodeStage / NodePublish with '-o context=xyz' mount option when mounting a ReadWriteOncePod volume
            used in Pod that has explicitly set SELinux context. In the future, it may be expanded to other
            volume AccessModes. In any case, Kubernetes will ensure that the volume is mounted only with a
            single SELinux context.  When 'false', Kubernetes won't pass any special SELinux mount options to
            the driver. This is typical for volumes that represent subdirectories of a bigger shared
            filesystem.  Default is 'false'.
        storageCapacity: storageCapacity indicates that the CSI volume driver wants pod scheduling to consider
            the storage capacity that the driver deployment will report by creating CSIStorageCapacity objects
            with capacity information, if set to true.  The check can be enabled immediately when deploying a
            driver. In that case, provisioning new volumes with late binding will pause until the driver
            deployment has published some suitable CSIStorageCapacity object.  Alternatively, the driver can
            be deployed with the field unset or false and it can be flipped later when storage capacity
            information has been published.  This field was immutable in Kubernetes <= 1.22 and now is
            mutable.
        tokenRequests: tokenRequests indicates the CSI driver needs pods' service account tokens it is
            mounting volume for to do necessary authentication. Kubelet will pass the tokens in VolumeContext
            in the CSI NodePublishVolume calls. The CSI driver should parse and validate the following
            VolumeContext: 'csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens': {   '<audience>': {     'token':
            <token>,     'expirationTimestamp': <expiration timestamp in RFC3339>,   },   ... }  Note:
            Audience in each TokenRequest should be different and at most one token is empty string. To
            receive a new token after expiry, RequiresRepublish can be used to trigger NodePublishVolume
            periodically.
        volumeLifecycleModes: volumeLifecycleModes defines what kind of volumes this CSI volume driver
            supports. The default if the list is empty is 'Persistent', which is the usage defined by the CSI
            specification and implemented in Kubernetes via the usual PV/PVC mechanism.  The other mode is
            'Ephemeral'. In this mode, volumes are defined inline inside the pod spec with CSIVolumeSource and
            their lifecycle is tied to the lifecycle of that pod. A driver has to be aware of this because it
            is only going to get a NodePublishVolume call for such a volume.  For more information about
            implementing this mode, see https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html A
            driver can support one or more of these modes and more modes may be added in the future.  This
            field is beta. This field is immutable.

    """CSIStorageCapacity stores the result of one CSI GetCapacity call. For a given StorageClass, this

    'standard' has '1234 GiB' available in 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east1' - StorageClass
    'localssd' has '10 GiB' available in 'kubernetes.io/hostname=knode-abc123'  The following three cases
    all imply that no capacity is available for a certain combination: - no object exists with suitable
    topology and storage class name - such an object exists, but the capacity is unset - such an object
    exists, but the capacity is zero  The producer of these objects can decide which approach is more
    suitable.  They are consumed by the kube-scheduler when a CSI driver opts into capacity-aware
    scheduling with CSIDriverSpec.StorageCapacity. The scheduler compares the MaximumVolumeSize against
    the requested size of pending volumes to filter out unsuitable nodes. If MaximumVolumeSize is unset,
    it falls back to a comparison against the less precise Capacity. If that is also unset, the scheduler
    assumes that capacity is insufficient and tries some other node.

            GetCapacityRequest with topology and parameters that match the previous fields.  The semantic is
