    Attributes
    ----------
        apiVersion: APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers
            should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized
            values.
        description: description is an arbitrary string that usually provides guidelines on when this priority
            class should be used.
        globalDefault: globalDefault specifies whether this PriorityClass should be considered as the default
            priority for pods that do not have any priority class. Only one PriorityClass can be marked as
            `globalDefault`. However, if more than one PriorityClasses exists with their `globalDefault` field
            set to true, the smallest value of such global default PriorityClasses will be used as the default
            priority.
        kind: Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer
            this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase.
        metadata: Standard object's metadata.
        preemptionPolicy: preemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with lower priority. One of
            Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to PreemptLowerPriority if unset.
        value: value represents the integer value of this priority class. This is the actual priority that
            pods receive when they have the name of this class in their pod spec.
