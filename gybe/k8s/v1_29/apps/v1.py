class StatefulSetSpec:

    Attributes

        minReadySeconds: Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready without any
            of its container crashing for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered
            available as soon as it is ready)
        ordinals: ordinals controls the numbering of replica indices in a StatefulSet. The default ordinals
            behavior assigns a '0' index to the first replica and increments the index by one for each
            additional replica requested. Using the ordinals field requires the StatefulSetStartOrdinal
            feature gate to be enabled, which is beta.
        persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy: persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy describes the lifecycle of
            persistent volume claims created from volumeClaimTemplates. By default, all persistent volume
            claims are created as needed and retained until manually deleted. This policy allows the lifecycle
            to be altered, for example by deleting persistent volume claims when their stateful set is
            deleted, or when their pod is scaled down. This requires the StatefulSetAutoDeletePVC feature gate
            to be enabled, which is alpha.  +optional
        podManagementPolicy: podManagementPolicy controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when
            replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is `OrderedReady`, where pods
            are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each
            pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The
            alternative policy is `Parallel` which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale
            without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once.
        replicas: replicas is the desired number of replicas of the given Template. These are replicas in the
            sense that they are instantiations of the same Template, but individual replicas also have a
            consistent identity. If unspecified, defaults to 1.
        revisionHistoryLimit: revisionHistoryLimit is the maximum number of revisions that will be maintained
            in the StatefulSet's revision history. The revision history consists of all revisions not
            represented by a currently applied StatefulSetSpec version. The default value is 10.
        selector: selector is a label query over pods that should match the replica count. It must match the
            pod template's labels.
        serviceName: serviceName is the name of the service that governs this StatefulSet. This service must
            exist before the StatefulSet, and is responsible for the network identity of the set. Pods get
            DNS/hostnames that follow the pattern: pod-specific-string.serviceName.default.svc.cluster.local
            where 'pod-specific-string' is managed by the StatefulSet controller.
        template: template is the object that describes the pod that will be created if insufficient replicas
            are detected. Each pod stamped out by the StatefulSet will fulfill this Template, but have a
            unique identity from the rest of the StatefulSet. Each pod will be named with the format
            <statefulsetname>-<podindex>. For example, a pod in a StatefulSet named 'web' with index number
            '3' would be named 'web-3'. The only allowed template.spec.restartPolicy value is 'Always'.
        updateStrategy: updateStrategy indicates the StatefulSetUpdateStrategy that will be employed to update
            Pods in the StatefulSet when a revision is made to Template.
        volumeClaimTemplates: volumeClaimTemplates is a list of claims that pods are allowed to reference. The
            StatefulSet controller is responsible for mapping network identities to claims in a way that
            maintains the identity of a pod. Every claim in this list must have at least one matching (by
            name) volumeMount in one container in the template. A claim in this list takes precedence over any
            volumes in the template, with the same name.
