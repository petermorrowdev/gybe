            reaches the server using an internal IP. Server looks at X-Forwarded-For header or X-Real-Ip

class ManagedFieldsEntry:
    """ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the

    Attributes
    ----------
        apiVersion: APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format
            is 'group/version' just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version
            of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.
        fieldsType: FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is
            currently only one possible value: 'FieldsV1'
        fieldsV1: FieldsV1 holds the first JSON version format as described in the 'FieldsV1' type.
        manager: Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
        operation: Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The
            only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
        subresource: Subresource is the name of the subresource used to update that object, or empty string if
            the object was updated through the main resource. The value of this field is used to distinguish
            between managers, even if they share the same name. For example, a status update will be distinct
            from a regular update using the same manager name. Note that the APIVersion field is not related
            to the Subresource field and it always corresponds to the version of the main resource.
        time: Time is the timestamp of when the ManagedFields entry was added. The timestamp will also be
            updated if a field is added, the manager changes any of the owned fields value or removes a field.
            The timestamp does not update when a field is removed from the entry because another manager took

@dataclass
class ObjectMeta:
    """ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must
    create.

    Attributes
    ----------
        annotations: Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by
            external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be
            preserved when modifying objects.
        creationTimestamp: CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was
            created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations.
            Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.  Populated by the
            system. Read-only. Null for lists.
        deletionGracePeriodSeconds: Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before
            it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be
            shortened. Read-only.
        deletionTimestamp: DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted.
            This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
            directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from
            resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list
            is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the
            deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although
            it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may
            request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful
            termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a
            hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API.
            In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an
            administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set,
            graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.  Populated by the system when a graceful
            deletion is requested. Read-only.
        finalizers: Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier
            for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp
            of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed
            and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck
            finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the
            finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component
            responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external
            system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting
            in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are
            not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
        generateName: GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY
            IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client
            will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The
            provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length
            of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.  If this field is specified and the
            generated name exists, the server will return a 409.  Applied only if Name is not specified.
        generation: A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by
            the system. Read-only.
        labels: Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select)
            objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services.
        managedFields: ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by
            that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set
            or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a
            specific apply path like 'ci-cd'. The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow
            used when modifying the object.
        name: Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some
            resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name
            is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated.
        namespace: Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is
            equivalent to the 'default' namespace, but 'default' is the canonical representation. Not all
            objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will
            be empty.  Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.
        ownerReferences: List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been
            deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an
            entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There
            cannot be more than one managing controller.
        resourceVersion: An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used
            by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change
            detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these
            values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular
            resource or set of resources.  Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque
            by clients and .
        selfLink: Deprecated: selfLink is a legacy read-only field that is no longer populated by the system.
        uid: UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the
            server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.
            Populated by the system. Read-only.
