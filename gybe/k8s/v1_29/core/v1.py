class Container:
    """A single application container that you want to run within a pod.

    Attributes
    ----------
        args: Arguments to the entrypoint. The container image's CMD is used if this is not provided. Variable
            references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be
            resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single
            $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. '$$(VAR_NAME)' will produce the string
            literal '$(VAR_NAME)'. Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the
            variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.
        command: Entrypoint array. Not executed within a shell. The container image's ENTRYPOINT is used if
            this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's
            environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be
            unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax:

            be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.
        env: List of environment variables to set in the container. Cannot be updated.
        envFrom: List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys defined within a
            source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container is
            starting. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will
            take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be
            updated.
        image: Container image name.
        imagePullPolicy: Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if :latest
            tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated.
        lifecycle: Actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events.
            Cannot be updated.
        livenessProbe: Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe fails.
            Cannot be updated.
        name: Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL. Each container in a pod must have a unique name
            (DNS_LABEL). Cannot be updated.
        ports: List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that
            port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default '0.0.0.0' address inside a
            container will be accessible from the network. Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may
            corrupt the data. For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255.
            Cannot be updated.
        readinessProbe: Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed from service
            endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated.
        resizePolicy: Resources resize policy for the container.
        resources: Compute Resources required by this container. Cannot be updated.
        restartPolicy: RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod. This
            field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is 'Always'. For non-init
            containers or when this field is not specified, the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's
            restart policy and the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as 'Always' for the init
            container will have the following effect: this init container will be continually restarted on
            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers have completed, all
            init containers with restartPolicy 'Always' will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal
            init containers and is often referred to as a 'sidecar' container. Although this init container
            still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before
            proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after
            this init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully completed.
        securityContext: SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with. If
            set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext.
        startupProbe: StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other
            probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be
            restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe
            parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or
            warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated.
        stdin: Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is
            not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false.
        stdinOnce: Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a
            single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach
            sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the
            first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client
            disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If
            this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default
            is false
        terminationMessagePath: Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message
            will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be
            brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater
            than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults
            to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
        terminationMessagePolicy: Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the
            contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and
            failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination
            message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048
            bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
        tty: Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true.
            Default is false.
        volumeDevices: volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.
        volumeMounts: Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated.
        workingDir: Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's default will be
            used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot be updated.

            specified, 'Always' is used. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
        runAsGroup: The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default if unset. May

        runAsNonRoot: Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will
            validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the
            container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in
            SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
            SecurityContext takes precedence.
        runAsUser: The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image
            metadata if unspecified. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and

            Value must be a positive integer.
        affinity: If specified, the pod's scheduling constraints
        automountServiceAccountToken: AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service account token

        enableServiceLinks: EnableServiceLinks indicates whether information about services should be injected
            into pod's environment variables, matching the syntax of Docker links. Optional: Defaults to true.
        ephemeralContainers: List of ephemeral containers run in this pod. Ephemeral containers may be run in
            an existing pod to perform user-initiated actions such as debugging. This list cannot be specified
            when creating a pod, and it cannot be modified by updating the pod spec. In order to add an
            ephemeral container to an existing pod, use the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource.

        hostIPC: Use the host's ipc namespace. Optional: Default to false.
        hostNetwork: Host networking requested for this pod. Use the host's network namespace. If this option

        hostPID: Use the host's pid namespace. Optional: Default to false.
        hostUsers: Use the host's user namespace. Optional: Default to true. If set to true or not present,
            the pod will be run in the host user namespace, useful for when the pod needs a feature only
            available to the host user namespace, such as loading a kernel module with CAP_SYS_MODULE. When
            set to false, a new userns is created for the pod. Setting false is useful for mitigating
            container breakout vulnerabilities even allowing users to run their containers as root without
            actually having root privileges on the host. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by
            servers that enable the UserNamespacesSupport feature.
        hostname: Specifies the hostname of the Pod If not specified, the pod's hostname will be set to a
            system-defined value.
        imagePullSecrets: ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to secrets in the same namespace
            to use for pulling any of the images used by this PodSpec. If specified, these secrets will be
            passed to individual puller implementations for them to use.
        initContainers: List of initialization containers belonging to the pod. Init containers are executed
            in order prior to containers being started. If any init container fails, the pod is considered to
            have failed and is handled according to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or
            normal container must be unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle
            actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements of an init
            container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the highest request/limit for each
            resource type, and then using the max of of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits
            are applied to init containers in a similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added or
            removed. Cannot be updated.
        nodeName: NodeName is a request to schedule this pod onto a specific node. If it is non-empty, the
            scheduler simply schedules this pod onto that node, assuming that it fits resource requirements.
        nodeSelector: NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a node. Selector
            which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on that node.
        os: Specifies the OS of the containers in the pod. Some pod and container fields are restricted if
            this is set.  If the OS field is set to linux, the following fields must be unset:
            -securityContext.windowsOptions  If the OS field is set to windows, following fields must be

            RuntimeClass. This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the RuntimeClass admission
            controller. If the RuntimeClass admission controller is enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod

            the overhead already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec, Overhead will
            be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass, otherwise it will remain unset and
            treated as zero.
        preemptionPolicy: PreemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with lower priority. One of
            Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to PreemptLowerPriority if unset.
        priority: The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the priority of the
            pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it prevents users from setting this field. The
            admission controller populates this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher
            the priority.
        priorityClassName: If specified, indicates the pod's priority. 'system-node-critical' and 'system-
            cluster-critical' are two special keywords which indicate the highest priorities with the former
            being the highest priority. Any other name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object with

            when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified in the readiness gates have status
            equal to 'True'
        resourceClaims: ResourceClaims defines which ResourceClaims must be allocated and reserved before the
            Pod is allowed to start. The resources will be made available to those containers which consume
            them by name.  This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature
            gate.  This field is immutable.
        restartPolicy: Restart policy for all containers within the pod. One of Always, OnFailure, Never. In
            some contexts, only a subset of those values may be permitted. Default to Always.
        runtimeClassName: RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which
            should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will
            not be run. If unset or empty, the 'legacy' RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class
            with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler.
        schedulerName: If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not specified, the
            pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.
        schedulingGates: SchedulingGates is an opaque list of values that if specified will block scheduling
            the pod. If schedulingGates is not empty, the pod will stay in the SchedulingGated state and the
            scheduler will not attempt to schedule the pod.  SchedulingGates can only be set at pod creation
            time, and be removed only afterwards.  This is a beta feature enabled by the
            PodSchedulingReadiness feature gate.
        securityContext: SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container settings.
            Optional: Defaults to empty.  See type description for default values of each field.
        serviceAccount: DeprecatedServiceAccount is a depreciated alias for ServiceAccountName. Deprecated:
            Use serviceAccountName instead.
        serviceAccountName: ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run this pod.
        setHostnameAsFQDN: If true the pod's hostname will be configured as the pod's FQDN, rather than the
            leaf name (the default). In Linux containers, this means setting the FQDN in the hostname field of
            the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname). In Windows containers, this means setting the
            registry value of hostname for the registry key
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesTcpipParameters to FQDN. If a pod does not
            have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false.
        shareProcessNamespace: Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When
            this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other containers in the same
            pod, and the first process in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and
            ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set. Optional: Default to false.
        subdomain: If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be '<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod
            namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>'. If not specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all.
        terminationGracePeriodSeconds: Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May
            be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop
            immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). If this value is nil, the default
            grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes
            running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly
            halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
            Defaults to 30 seconds.
        tolerations: If specified, the pod's tolerations.
        topologySpreadConstraints: TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group of pods ought to spread
            across topology domains. Scheduler will schedule pods in a way which abides by the constraints.
            All topologySpreadConstraints are ANDed.
        volumes: List of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the pod.

class TopologySpreadConstraint:
    """TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given topology.

    Attributes
    ----------
        labelSelector: LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are
            counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain.
        matchLabelKeys: MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will
            be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value
            labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will
            be calculated for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and
            LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. Keys that don't exist in
            the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against
            labelSelector.  This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature
            gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
        maxSkew: MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When
            `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of
            matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum
            number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less
            than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |
            P P  |  P P  |   P   | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become
            2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate
            MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When
            `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that
            satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
        minDomains: MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible
            domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats 'global
            minimum' as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible
            domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on
            scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler
            won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as
            if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil,
            WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2,
            MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 |
            zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so 'global
            minimum' is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be
            scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three
            zones, it will violate MaxSkew.  This is a beta field and requires the
            MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
        nodeAffinityPolicy: NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
            when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching
            nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
            are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.  If this value is nil, the behavior is
            equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the
            NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
        nodeTaintsPolicy: NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod
            topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for
            which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All
            nodes are included.  If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This
            is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature
            flag.
        topologyKey: TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and
            identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a
            'bucket', and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a
            particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet
            the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is
            'kubernetes.io/hostname', each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is
            'topology.kubernetes.io/zone', each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.
        whenUnsatisfiable: WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread
            constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway
            tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,   but giving higher precedence to
            topologies that would help reduce the   skew. A constraint is considered 'Unsatisfiable' for an
            incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate 'MaxSkew' on
            some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
            labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If
            WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to
            become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the
            cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required
            field.

            on whether attempting to use the Assigned config results in an error.
        assigned: Assigned reports the checkpointed config the node will try to use. When
            Node.Spec.ConfigSource is updated, the node checkpoints the associated config payload to local
            disk, along with a record indicating intended config. The node refers to this record to choose its
            config checkpoint, and reports this record in Assigned. Assigned only updates in the status after
            the record has been checkpointed to disk. When the Kubelet is restarted, it tries to make the
            Assigned config the Active config by loading and validating the checkpointed payload identified by
            Assigned.
        error: Error describes any problems reconciling the Spec.ConfigSource to the Active config. Errors may
            occur, for example, attempting to checkpoint Spec.ConfigSource to the local Assigned record,
            attempting to checkpoint the payload associated with Spec.ConfigSource, attempting to load or
            validate the Assigned config, etc. Errors may occur at different points while syncing config.
            Earlier errors (e.g. download or checkpointing errors) will not result in a rollback to
            LastKnownGood, and may resolve across Kubelet retries. Later errors (e.g. loading or validating a
            checkpointed config) will result in a rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter case, it is usually
            possible to resolve the error by fixing the config assigned in Spec.ConfigSource. You can find
            additional information for debugging by searching the error message in the Kubelet log. Error is a
            human-readable description of the error state; machines can check whether or not Error is empty,

            encounters an error attempting to use the Assigned config. The Assigned config becomes the
            LastKnownGood config when the node determines that the Assigned config is stable and correct. This
            is currently implemented as a 10-minute soak period starting when the local record of Assigned
            config is updated. If the Assigned config is Active at the end of this period, it becomes the
            LastKnownGood. Note that if Spec.ConfigSource is reset to nil (use local defaults), the
            LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil, because the local default config is always assumed
            good. You should not make assumptions about the node's method of determining config stability and

            started yet. A pod can be assigned to a node that has a problem in kubelet which in turns mean
            that HostIP will not be updated even if there is a node is assigned to pod
        hostIPs: hostIPs holds the IP addresses allocated to the host. If this field is specified, the first
            entry must match the hostIP field. This list is empty if the pod has not started yet. A pod can be
            assigned to a node that has a problem in kubelet which in turns means that HostIPs will not be
            updated even if there is a node is assigned to this pod.
        initContainerStatuses: The list has one entry per init container in the manifest. The most recent
            successful init container will have ready = true, the most recently started container will have
            startTime set.
        message: A human readable message indicating details about why the pod is in this condition.
        nominatedNodeName: nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on the node, but it
            cannot be scheduled right away as preemption victims receive their graceful termination periods.
            This field does not guarantee that the pod will be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide to
            place the pod elsewhere if other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide to give
            the resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created after preemption. As a result,
            this field may be different than PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is scheduled.
        phase: The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle. The
            conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status arrays
            contain more detail about the pod's status. There are five possible phase values:  Pending: The
            pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the container images has not
            been created. This includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent downloading images
            over the network, which could take a while. Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of
            the containers have been created. At least one container is still running, or is in the process of
            starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will
            not be restarted. Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container
            has terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by
            the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to
            an error in communicating with the host of the pod.
        podIP: podIP address allocated to the pod. Routable at least within the cluster. Empty if not yet
            allocated.
        podIPs: podIPs holds the IP addresses allocated to the pod. If this field is specified, the 0th entry
            must match the podIP field. Pods may be allocated at most 1 value for each of IPv4 and IPv6. This
            list is empty if no IPs have been allocated yet.
        qosClass: The Quality of Service (QOS) classification assigned to the pod based on resource
            requirements See PodQOSClass type for available QOS classes
        reason: A brief CamelCase message indicating details about why the pod is in this state. e.g.
            'Evicted'
        resize: Status of resources resize desired for pod's containers. It is empty if no resources resize is
            pending. Any changes to container resources will automatically set this to 'Proposed'
        resourceClaimStatuses: Status of resource claims.
        startTime: RFC 3339 date and time at which the object was acknowledged by the Kubelet. This is before
            the Kubelet pulled the container image(s) for the pod.

        name: The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL. All ports within a
            ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering the endpoints for a Service, this must match
            the 'name' field in the EndpointPort. Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service.
        nodePort: The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or
            LoadBalancer.  Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified, in-range, and not in use
            it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if
            this Service requires one.  If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need
            it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it
            (e.g. changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP).
        port: The port that will be exposed by this service.
        protocol: The IP protocol for this port. Supports 'TCP', 'UDP', and 'SCTP'. Default is TCP.
        targetPort: Number or name of the port to access on the pods targeted by the service. Number must be
            in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME. If this is a string, it will be looked up
            as a named port in the target Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the value of the
            'port' field is used (an identity map). This field is ignored for services with clusterIP=None,
            and should be omitted or set equal to the 'port' field.

@dataclass
class ServiceSpec:
    """ServiceSpec describes the attributes that a user creates on a service.

    Attributes
    ----------
        allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will be
            automatically allocated for services with type LoadBalancer.  Default is 'true'. It may be set to
            'false' if the cluster load-balancer does not rely on NodePorts.  If the caller requests specific
            NodePorts (by specifying a value), those requests will be respected, regardless of this field.
            This field may only be set for services with type LoadBalancer and will be cleared if the type is
            changed to any other type.
        clusterIP: clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly. If an address
            is specified manually, is in-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will be
            allocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may not be
            changed through updates unless the type field is also being changed to ExternalName (which
            requires this field to be blank) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in which
            case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are 'None', empty
            string (''), or a valid IP address. Setting this to 'None' makes a 'headless service' (no virtual
            IP), which is useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is not required.
            Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified when
            creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when
            updating a Service to type ExternalName.
        clusterIPs: ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and are usually assigned
            randomly.  If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per system configuration), and is
            not in use, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This
            field may not be changed through updates unless the type field is also being changed to
            ExternalName (which requires this field to be empty) or the type field is being changed from
            ExternalName (in which case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid
            values are 'None', empty string (''), or a valid IP address.  Setting this to 'None' makes a
            'headless service' (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred
            and proxying is not required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If
            this field is specified when creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This
            field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not specified,
            it will be initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified, clients must ensure
            that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the same value.  This field may hold a maximum of two
            entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order). These IPs must correspond to the values of the
            ipFamilies field. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
        externalIPs: externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept
            traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes.  The user is responsible for
            ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancers
            that are not part of the Kubernetes system.
        externalName: externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms will return as an alias
            for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). No proxying will be involved.  Must be a lowercase
            RFC-1123 hostname (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires `type` to be 'ExternalName'.
        externalTrafficPolicy: externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
            receive on one of the Service's 'externally-facing' addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and
            LoadBalancer IPs). If set to 'Local', the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes
            that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so
            each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without
            masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be
            dropped.) The default value, 'Cluster', uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints
            evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External
            IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get 'Cluster' semantics, but clients
            sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when
            picking a node.
        healthCheckNodePort: healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. This only
            applies when type is set to LoadBalancer and externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. If a value is
            specified, is in-range, and is not in use, it will be used.  If not specified, a value will be
            automatically allocated.  External systems (e.g. load-balancers) can use this port to determine if
            a given node holds endpoints for this service or not.  If this field is specified when creating a
            Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a
            Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type). This field cannot be updated once set.
        internalTrafficPolicy: InternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
            receive on the ClusterIP. If set to 'Local', the proxy will assume that pods only want to talk to
            endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod, dropping the traffic if there are no local
            endpoints. The default value, 'Cluster', uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints
            evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features).
        ipFamilies: IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this service. This field
            is usually assigned automatically based on cluster configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If
            this field is specified manually, the requested family is available in the cluster, and
            ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field
            is conditionally mutable: it allows for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not
            allow changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are 'IPv4' and 'IPv6'.  This
            field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to
            'headless' services. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.  This
            field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in either order).  These families
            must correspond to the values of the clusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and
            ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
        ipFamilyPolicy: IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required by this Service.
            If there is no value provided, then this field will be set to SingleStack. Services can be
            'SingleStack' (a single IP family), 'PreferDualStack' (two IP families on dual-stack configured
            clusters or a single IP family on single-stack clusters), or 'RequireDualStack' (two IP families
            on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). The ipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on
            the value of this field. This field will be wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName.
        loadBalancerClass: loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation this Service
            belongs to. If specified, the value of this field must be a label-style identifier, with an
            optional prefix, e.g. 'internal-vip' or 'example.com/internal-vip'. Unprefixed names are reserved
            for end-users. This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the
            default load balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud
            provider integration, but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that
            a load balancer implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load
            balancer implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field. This
            field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'. Once set, it can
            not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.
        loadBalancerIP: Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer. This feature depends on whether the
            underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created.
            This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature. Deprecated: This
            field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations. Using it is non-portable
            and it may not support dual-stack. Users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations
            when available.
        loadBalancerSourceRanges: If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic
            through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This
            field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.'
        ports: The list of ports that are exposed by this service.
        publishNotReadyAddresses: publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints
            for this Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready. The primary use case for
            setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to propagate SRV DNS records for its
            Pods for the purpose of peer discovery. The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and
            EndpointSlice resources for Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered
            'ready' even if the Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated
            endpoints through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.
        selector: Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this selector. If empty or
            not present, the service is assumed to have an external process managing its endpoints, which
            Kubernetes will not modify. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored
            if type is ExternalName.
        sessionAffinity: Supports 'ClientIP' and 'None'. Used to maintain session affinity. Enable client IP
            based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to None.
        sessionAffinityConfig: sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity.
        type: type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid options are
            ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. 'ClusterIP' allocates a cluster-internal IP
            address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is
            not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If
            clusterIP is 'None', no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of
            endpoints rather than a virtual IP. 'NodePort' builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every
            node which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. 'LoadBalancer' builds on NodePort and
            creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same
            endpoints as the clusterIP. 'ExternalName' aliases this service to the specified externalName.
            Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.
